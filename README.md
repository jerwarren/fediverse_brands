# Early version of "Brands on the Fediverse" blocklist, that people who also hate seeing brands on the fediverse can use to eradicate them

Just download the blocks.csv (or mutes.csv) file and import them into your fediverse account (either as blocks or mutes.)

If you are currently following any of these brands, they *will* be blocked, so it's probably worth giving it a once over before importing. 

Additionally, it's probably worth downloading and saving a copy of your current blocks.csv so that you can upload it in "overwrite" mode to purge all these back out again when you realize you've made a horrible mistake...

Eventually I may make it possible to do a delta to ensure you're only nuking accounts you aren't already following. But if those accounts are brands, and you're here to blok brands, you *want* them blocked, right? *Right*?
