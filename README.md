# Early version of "Brands on the Fediverse" blocklist people who also hate seeing brands on the fediverse can use to eradicate them

Just download the blocks.csv file and import them into your fediverse account (either as blocks or mutes.)

If you are currently following any of these brands, they *will* be blocked, so it's probably worth giving it a once over before importing. Eventually I may make it possible to do a delta to ensure you're only nuking accounts you aren't already following. But if those accounts are brands, and you're here to blok brands, you *want* them blocked, right? Right?
